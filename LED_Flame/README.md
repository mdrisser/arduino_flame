# LED Flame Effect

This is the first of two sketches attempting to mimic a natural gas flame, I need to determine which approach works better.

This sketch mimics a natural gas flame. It is based on a Jacklyn Smith Christmas Lantern purchased from Kmart. The effect looks very natural behind a peice of frosted glass.

## The Circuit
