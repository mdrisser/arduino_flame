# Arduino LED Flame
> Code to mimic a flame using Arduino and 5 LEDs.

This is an attempt to mimic the gas flame effect I found in a Christmas lantern from Kmart. After opening up the lantern, I found that the effect is produced using 5 LEDs and two unmarked ICs. So, I decided to attempt to mimic the effect using 5 LEDs and and Arduino Nano.

There are currently two seperate sketches [LED_Flame](LED_Flame) and [LED_Gas_Flame](LED_Gas_Flame). I am trying to determine which route would be the best one to take to mimic the effect.

## Diagrams
You can find the wiring diagram, generated with Fritzing, [here](Docs/LED_Flame-Wiring.png) and the schematic is available in the Docs folder [here](Docs/LED_Flame_schematic). The Fritizing file is also available in the Docs folder [here](Docs/LED_Flame.fzz).
