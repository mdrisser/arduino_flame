# Arduino LED Flame
> Code to mimic a flame using Arduino and 5 LEDs.

This is an attempt to mimic the gas flame effect I found in a Christmas lantern from Kmart. After opening up the lantern, I found that the effect is produced using 5 LEDs and two unmarked ICs. So, I decided to attempt to mimic the effect using 5 LEDs and and Arduino Nano.

There are currently two seperate sketches. I am trying to determine which route would be the best one to take to mimic the effect.
