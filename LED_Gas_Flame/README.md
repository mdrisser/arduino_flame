# LED Gas Flame

This is an alternative approach to creating the gas flame effect.

I need to determine which approch will work better.

This sketch mimics a natural gas flame. It is based on a Jacklyn Smith Christmas Lantern purchased from Kmart. The effect looks very natural behind a piece of frosted glass.
